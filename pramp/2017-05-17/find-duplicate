Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of passport numbers, implement a function findDuplicates that returns an array of all passport numbers that are both in arr1 and arr2. Note that the output array should be sorted in an ascending order.

Let N and M be the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively. Solve for two cases and analyze the time & space complexities of your solutions: M ≈ N - the array lengths are approximately the same M ≫ N - arr2 is much bigger than arr1.

Example:

input:  arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], arr2 = [3, 6, 7, 8, 20]

output: [3, 6, 7] # since only these three values are both in arr1 and arr2

Constraints:

    [time limit] 5000ms

    [input] array.integer arr1
        1 ≤ arr1.length ≤ 100

    [input] array.integer arr2
        1 ≤ arr2.length ≤ 100

    [output] array.integer



As with any array traversal, watch out for any array out of bound runtime errors.

- If your peer is stuck, ask for the brute force solution and then ask how they can optimize that.
- If still no progress, remind your peer that the arrays are sorted and ask them how they can use this fact to implement an efficient solution.
- One way to solve this problem is to use the Set data structure. We store the values of one array into the set and then look up the values of the other array. The time complexity for this algorithm is O(N+M), however it requires the use of an extra space due to the allocation of the set. Preferably we should avoid that, especially in the second case where M ≫ N.

Solution

- The brute force solution consists of two nested loops. For every value arr1[i] in the outer loop, we look it up in arr2 in the inner loop. The time complexity of this algorithm in the worst case scenario is O(N⋅M). Not very efficient. We can do better than that.

Case 1 (M ≈ N)

We can use the fact the arrays are sorted to traverse both of them in an in-order manner at the same time. The general idea of the algorithm is to use two indices, i and j, for arr1 and arr2, respectively. Every time one of indices, let’s say i without any loss of generality, points to a value that is smaller than the value pointed by other index, we increment i. If arr1[i] == arr2[j], we add the value to the output array and increment both indices.

Time Complexity: O(N+M) since in the worst case scenario we traverse both arrays once. Note that O(N+M) is a linear time complexity because the input size is O(N+M) as well.

Space Complexity: the variable duplicates is the only dynamic auxiliary space we’re using in the algorithm. In the worst case scenario, the size of duplicates is going to be as big as big as the smaller input array. For instance, when the smaller array is fully contained within the bigger one. The space complexity is therefore O(N), where N ≤ M.

Case 2 (M ≫ N)

When one array is substantially longer than the other, we should try to avoid traversing the longer one. Instead, we can traverse the shorter array and look up its values in the longer array by using the binary search algorithm. We explain why this approach is superior in this case to the previous one in the complexity analysis section.



Time Complexity: we running a binary search on arr2 N times. Hence the time complexity is O(N⋅log(M)). So why is this algorithm better than the previous one when M ≫ N? To demonstrate that let’s analyze the case that M = N^C, where C is a constant such that C 2. In this case, the time complexity of the second algorithm is: O(N⋅log(M)) = O(N⋅log(N^C)) = O(C⋅N⋅log(N)) = O(N⋅log(N)) And the time complexity of the first algorithm is: O(N + M) = O(N + N^C) = O(N^C) As we all know O(N^C) > O(N⋅log(N)).

Space Complexity: the variable duplicates is the only dynamic auxiliary space we’re using in the algorithm. In the worst case scenario, the size of duplicates is going to be as big as big as the smaller input array. For instance, when the smaller array is fully contained within the bigger one. The space complexity is therefore O(N), where N ≤ M.
