Thank you so much for the offer for the Software Engineer Intern position. I so appreciate you taking the time to consider me and for answering so many of my questions about the company and role. While this position seems like a great opportunity, after a considerable amount of time I've been spent on thinking about this offer, I have decided to pursue another role that will offer me more opportunities to pursue my interests. Since I'm still doing my research in the laboratory after the last contest I mentioned.

Itâ€™s been a pleasure getting to know you, and I hope that we cross paths in the future. Again, thank you for your time and support, and I wish you all the best.

Best wishes for your continued success.

Sincerely,
